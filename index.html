            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
            the Big Bang.
            Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
            A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special
            energy that exerted a repulsive force,
            causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
            and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities.
            Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="">first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the
            South
            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
            ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a
            universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
            They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
            Dr. Guth was correct.

        <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
            including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
            to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
            It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
            extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
            is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
            architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
            number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
        </p>

        <p class="paraBold"><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>
        <p>
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
            forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
            according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
            said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave
            radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe
            when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep,
            for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific
            briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to
            The Astrophysical Journal.

                    But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that

                    Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently
                    expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

            Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation
            in his lifetime. <br>
            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”<br>
            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
            Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
            meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
            Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.<br>
            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
            words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.<br>
            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
            known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin
            Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne
            to tell him the news.

                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that
                we
                ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an
                email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having
                news
                like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
            </p>

                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
                astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go
                down
                as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
            </p>
            <p>
                John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                called
                the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and
                very
                convincing,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
                universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
                expressed reservations about inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that
                the
                new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
                European
                Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year.
                At
                least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

            <p>
                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
                discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
                Prize.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of
                Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where
                the
                thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
                Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has
                been
                there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the

            <p>
                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
                light
                waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
                waves,
                squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction
                of
                polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should
                have
                little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
                microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
            </p>
            <p>
                The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
                supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
                breakthrough.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>A Special Time</strong></h3>
            <p>
                The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his
                Palo
                Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and
                weak
                nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
                unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
                mythology
                of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after
                another
                splitting away.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was where Dr. Guth came in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
                until
                it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space
                itself
                would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
                universe
                would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
                created,
                the harder it pushed apart.
            </p>
            <p>
                What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
                submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of
                normal
                cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
                billions
                of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to
                say,
                “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
                suggest
                that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey
                expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a
                concept
                known as the multiverse.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
                deeper
                into the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
                forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part
                of
                the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
